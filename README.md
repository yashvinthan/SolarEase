## 1. Project Overview

### What is SolarEase?

SolarEase is a customer-facing Android application designed to guide residential and commercial customers through the complete solar installation lifecycle — from initial site assessment and system recommendation through payment, installation tracking, and long-term performance monitoring.

The application eliminates the traditionally fragmented, paper-heavy solar installation process by providing a single digital touchpoint for the customer from day one through the operational life of their solar system.

### Business Problem

The solar installation industry in India suffers from several critical pain points that SolarEase is designed to solve:

| Problem | Impact | SolarEase Solution |
|---|---|---|
| No unified customer journey | Customers interact with multiple disconnected systems | Single end-to-end app |
| Manual subsidy calculations | Errors in PM Surya Ghar subsidy eligibility | Automated subsidy engine |
| Lack of installation visibility | Customers have no real-time update on progress | Installation milestone tracker |
| Opaque pricing | No transparency in cost breakdown | Detailed cost estimation with line items |
| Post-installation disconnect | No ongoing engagement after system goes live | Live performance, financial, and environmental dashboard |
| EB service number complexity | TANGEDCO consumer numbers are complex and region-encoded | Automated consumer number parser and region mapper |

### Target Users

- **Residential Customers** — Homeowners looking to install rooftop solar systems (1 kW–10 kW range)
- **Commercial Customers** — Small to medium businesses evaluating solar for operational cost reduction
- **Industrial Customers** — Large-scale ground-mounted or rooftop installations

### Primary Objectives

1. Digitize the end-to-end solar customer acquisition and installation lifecycle
2. Automate solar system sizing, cost estimation, and government subsidy calculation
3. Provide real-time installation milestone tracking
4. Deliver post-installation performance, financial ROI, and environmental impact monitoring
5. Establish a scalable foundation for integration with the SolarEase Platform backend management platform

### Value Proposition

> SolarEase turns a traditionally complex, multi-week engagement into a streamlined digital experience — from the first tap to a live solar system.

Customers get instant system recommendations, transparent cost breakdowns, automated subsidy eligibility, live installation tracking, and lifetime performance analytics — all within a single application.

#### Business Logic — Consumer Number Parser

The `ConsumerNumberParser` decodes a 12-digit TANGEDCO consumer number into structured components:

```
Format: RR SSS DDD NNNN
         ^^             = Region Code (2 digits)
            ^^^         = Section Code (3 digits)
                ^^^     = Distribution Code (3 digits)
                    ^^^^ = Service Number (4 digits)
```

**Region Code Mapping** (`RegionCodeMapper`):

| Code | Region |
|---|---|
| 01 | Chennai North |
| 02 | Villupuram |
| 03 | Coimbatore |
| 04 | Erode |
| 05 | Madurai |
| 06 | Trichy |
| 07 | Tirunelveli |

```

---

### Step-by-Step Journey Description

#### Step 1 — App Launch & Session Check

On launch, `MainActivity` initializes `UserSession` from `SharedPreferences`. If `onboardingCompleted == true`, the app navigates directly to the Customer Dashboard. Otherwise, the user starts at the Auth flow.

> In DEBUG builds, the session is always cleared to force the full onboarding flow for testing purposes.

---

#### Step 2 — Phone Number Registration (`AuthPhone`)

The customer enters their full name and 10-digit mobile number. The app validates the number (minimum 10 digits) and initiates OTP delivery.

**Data collected:** `fullName`, `phoneNumber`

---

#### Step 3 — OTP Verification (`AuthOtp`)

A 6-digit OTP is sent to the customer's mobile number. The customer enters the OTP to verify their identity.

- Max 3 attempts allowed
- After 3 failures: 15-minute lockout
- On success: `User` object is created and stored in `UserSession` / `SharedPreferences`

**Data stored:** `User(customerName, mobileNumber)`

---

#### Step 4 — Profile Photo (`AuthProfile`)

The customer uploads or captures a profile photo. This is mandatory before proceeding.

---

#### Step 5 — EB Service Number (`EbServiceNumber`)

The customer enters their 12-digit TANGEDCO consumer number. The app:
1. Validates the number (exactly 12 digits, all numeric)
2. Parses region code, section code, distribution code, and service number
3. Validates the region code against the known TANGEDCO region map
4. Displays the formatted number as `XX XXX XXX XXXX`

**Data stored:** `ebServiceNumber` in `UserSession`

---

#### Step 6 — Customer Category (`CustomerCategory`)

The customer selects their category:
- **Residential** — Home installation
- **Commercial** — Business/office installation
- **Industrial** — Factory/large-scale installation

This selection influences subsidy eligibility (currently subsidy logic is not category-gated, but this is reserved for future policy changes).

---

#### Step 7 — System Type (`SystemType`)

The customer selects the type of solar system:
- **On-Grid** — Connected to the electricity grid; supports net metering and government subsidy
- **Off-Grid** — Fully independent with battery storage; no grid dependency
- **Hybrid** — Battery storage combined with grid connectivity; maximum flexibility

**Business Rule:** Only On-Grid + DCR panel combination qualifies for PM Surya Ghar government subsidy.

---

#### Step 8 — Assessment Input (`AssessmentInput`)

The customer provides:
- **Monthly Electricity Consumption** (kWh) — From their EB bill
- **Available Roof/Ground Area** (sqm) — Space available for panel installation
- **Mount Type** — Rooftop or Ground-mounted

The `EstimateCalculator` immediately computes:
- Recommended system capacity (kW)
- Required installation area (sqm)
- Feasibility status (Suitable / Insufficient Area)

---

#### Step 9 — Solar Recommendation (`Recommendation`)

Displays the system recommendation:
- Recommended capacity in kW
- Required area vs. available area
- Feasibility assessment
- System type confirmation

Customer proceeds to panel selection or navigates back to adjust inputs.

---

#### Step 10 — Panel Selection (`PanelSelection`)

Customer selects panel type:

| Option | Description | Subsidy Eligible |
|---|---|---|
| DCR | Domestic Content Requirement — Indian-manufactured panels | ✅ (On-Grid only) |
| Non-DCR | Imported or mixed panels — generally lower cost | ❌ |

---

#### Step 11 — Cost Estimation (`CostEstimation`)

Full financial breakdown is computed and displayed:
- Base cost per kW (based on panel type and mount type)
- Panels/inverter cost (70% of gross)
- Mounting/wiring cost (18% of gross)
- Labour cost (12% of gross)
- System type add-on (Off-Grid: +₹25,000/kW, Hybrid: +₹20,000/kW)
- Government subsidy (if eligible)
- Net payable after subsidy
- Annual savings estimate
- Estimated payback period

---

#### Step 12 — Payment Option (`PaymentOption`)

Customer selects their preferred payment method:
- Full Cash Payment
- Bank Transfer
- Solar Loan
- EMI Financing

The complete `SolarEstimateResult` is carried forward as navigation arguments into this screen.

---

#### Step 13 — Order Summary (`OrderSummary`)

A final review screen showing:
- System capacity, type, mount, panel type
- Payment method selected
- Gross total, subsidy deduction, net payable

On confirmation, the order is submitted and the customer advances to post-order tracking.

---

#### Step 14 — Site Survey Status (`SiteSurveyStatus`)

After order placement, a physical site survey is scheduled. This screen shows the current status of the survey:
- Scheduled / In Progress / Completed
- Survey date and time (when available)
- Ability to reschedule via `RescheduleBottomSheet`

---

#### Step 15 — Installation Tracking (`InstallationTracking`)

Real-time milestone tracking for the physical installation. Milestones are workflow-specific — different for On-Grid, Off-Grid, and Hybrid systems (see Section 6).

---

#### Step 16 — Customer Dashboard (`CustomerDashboard`)

After installation completes, the app pops back to the auth origin and navigates to the persistent Customer Dashboard. The dashboard provides:
- Live system status and health
- Today's generation, savings, and CO2 impact
- Lifetime totals
- Recent activities and notifications
- Navigation to the four sub-modules: My Solar System, Performance, Financial, Environmental

---

## 5. Solar Calculation Engine

The solar calculation engine lives entirely in `com.example.feature.assessment.util` and is a pure Kotlin object — no Android dependencies, fully unit-testable.

### 5.1 System Capacity Calculation

**File:** `EstimateCalculator.kt`

```
Recommended System Size (kW) = Monthly Consumption (kWh) ÷ DIVISOR

Where DIVISOR = 120.0
```

**Rationale:** The divisor of 120 is derived from the assumption of approximately 4 peak sun hours per day × 30 days = 120 peak sun hours per month. This gives the DC system size required to offset the monthly consumption.

The result is rounded to 1 decimal place.

**Example:**
- Monthly Consumption = 300 kWh
- Recommended Size = 300 ÷ 120 = **2.5 kW**

---

### 5.2 Area Requirement Calculation

```
Required Area (sqm) = Recommended Capacity (kW) × AREA_PER_KW

Where AREA_PER_KW = 10.0 sqm/kW
```

**Rationale:** Standard residential solar panel (approximately 400W) occupies approximately 2 sqm. A 1 kW system requires approximately 2.5 panels, therefore approximately 10 sqm per kW.

**Example:**
- System Size = 2.5 kW
- Required Area = 2.5 × 10 = **25 sqm**

**Feasibility Check:**
```
if (requiredArea <= availableArea) → "Suitable"
else → "Insufficient Area"
```

---

### 5.3 Cost Calculation

#### Base Rate Matrix

| Panel Type | Mount Type | Base Rate (INR/kW) |
|---|---|---|
| DCR | Ground | ₹62,000 |
| DCR | Rooftop | ₹55,000 |
| Non-DCR | Ground | ₹54,000 |
| Non-DCR | Rooftop | ₹48,000 |

#### System Type Add-on Cost

| System Type | Additional Cost (INR/kW) |
|---|---|
| On-Grid | ₹0 (no addition) |
| Hybrid | +₹20,000 |
| Off-Grid | +₹25,000 |

#### Final Cost Calculation

```
Final Rate per kW = Base Rate + System Type Add-on
Gross Total = Recommended Capacity × Final Rate per kW
```

#### Cost Component Breakdown

| Component | Percentage of Gross Total |
|---|---|
| Panels + Inverter | 70% |
| Mounting Structure + Wiring | 18% |
| Installation + Labour | 12% |

**Example — 2.5 kW, On-Grid, DCR, Rooftop:**
```
Final Rate = ₹55,000 + ₹0 = ₹55,000/kW
Gross Total = 2.5 × ₹55,000 = ₹1,37,500
Panels/Inverter = ₹1,37,500 × 0.70 = ₹96,250
Mounting/Wiring = ₹1,37,500 × 0.18 = ₹24,750
Labour = ₹1,37,500 × 0.12 = ₹16,500
```

---

### 5.4 Government Subsidy Calculation (PM Surya Ghar)

**File:** `SubsidyCalculator.kt`

#### Eligibility Rules

Subsidy is applicable **only** when:
1. System Type = **On-Grid**
2. Panel Type = **DCR**

Both conditions must be true. All other combinations return `eligible = false`.

#### Subsidy Tier Structure

| Capacity Range | Subsidy Formula |
|---|---|
| Up to 2 kW | ₹30,000 × capacity (kW) |
| 2 kW to 3 kW | ₹60,000 + (₹18,000 × (capacity − 2)) |
| Above 3 kW | ₹78,000 (capped) |

**Examples:**

| Capacity | Calculation | Subsidy Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 1 kW | 1 × ₹30,000 | ₹30,000 |
| 2 kW | 2 × ₹30,000 | ₹60,000 |
| 2.5 kW | ₹60,000 + (0.5 × ₹18,000) | ₹69,000 |
| 3 kW | ₹60,000 + (1 × ₹18,000) | ₹78,000 |
| 5 kW | Capped at | ₹78,000 |
| 10 kW | Capped at | ₹78,000 |

---

### 5.5 Net Payable Calculation

```
Net Payable = Gross Total − Subsidy Amount

If Net Payable < 0 → Net Payable = 0  (subsidy cannot exceed system cost)
```

---

### 5.6 Annual Savings & Payback Period

**Electricity Tariff Rate:** `TARIFF_PER_KWH = ₹7.00/kWh`

```
Annual Savings (INR) = Monthly Consumption (kWh) × 12 × ₹7.00

Payback Period (years) = Net Payable ÷ Annual Savings
```

Result is rounded to 1 decimal place.

**Example — 2.5 kW, 300 kWh/month, On-Grid, DCR, Rooftop:**
```
Annual Savings = 300 × 12 × 7 = ₹25,200/year
Net Payable = ₹1,37,500 − ₹69,000 = ₹68,500
Payback Period = ₹68,500 ÷ ₹25,200 = 2.7 years
```

---

### 5.7 Input Validation Rules

**File:** `Validation.kt`

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Monthly Consumption | Must be a positive number, maximum 5 digits |
| Available Area | Must be a positive number, maximum 100,000 sqm |

---

## 6. Installation Workflows

Each system type (On-Grid, Off-Grid, Hybrid) has a distinct installation workflow due to different technical requirements. The `InstallationRepositoryImpl` manages three separate milestone flows.

### 6.1 On-Grid Installation Workflow

**Applicable when:** `systemType == "On-Grid"` or default

**Why different:** On-Grid systems must connect to the electricity grid, which requires EB/DISCOM inspection, net meter installation, and formal grid synchronization — regulatory steps not required for Off-Grid systems.

| # | Milestone Key | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SITE_SURVEY_COMPLETED` | Site Survey Completed | Physical site inspection; technical data collected |
| 2 | `FEASIBILITY_APPROVED` | Feasibility & Load Sanction Approved | Technical feasibility verified; regulatory approvals obtained |
| 3 | `MATERIALS_DISPATCHED` | Materials Dispatched | Panels, inverter, mounting structure shipped |
| 4 | `INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS` | Installation In Progress | On-site installation with sub-activities and progress percentage |
| 5 | `INSTALLATION_COMPLETED` | Installation Completed | Mechanical and electrical installation done |
| 6 | `TESTING_WCR` | Testing & Internal Commissioning (WCR) | Electrical testing, inverter configuration, internal commissioning |
| 7 | `EB_INSPECTION` | EB / DISCOM Physical Inspection | Electricity Board official inspection |
| 8 | `NET_METER_INSTALLED` | Net Meter Installed & Approved | Bidirectional meter installed and approved |
| 9 | `GRID_SYNC` | Grid Synchronization | System synchronized with the electricity grid |
| 10 | `SYSTEM_LIVE` | Project Completed & System Live | System fully operational |

**Sub-activities during INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS:**
1. Mounting Structure Installation
2. Solar Panel Installation
3. Inverter Installation
4. Electrical Wiring

---

### 6.2 Off-Grid Installation Workflow

**Applicable when:** `systemType == "Off-Grid"`

**Why different:** Off-Grid systems include battery banks and do not connect to the electricity grid. There is no need for EB inspection, net meter, or grid synchronization. Instead, a battery sizing/load audit and battery backup verification replace those steps.

```mermaid

### 6.3 Hybrid Installation Workflow

**Applicable when:** `systemType == "Hybrid"`

**Why different:** Hybrid systems combine battery storage with grid connectivity. They require both the battery commissioning steps of Off-Grid AND the EB inspection/net meter/grid sync steps of On-Grid — making this the most complex workflow.

### 6.4 Milestone Progression Rules

- Only one milestone is `IN_PROGRESS` at a time
- When a milestone is marked `COMPLETED`, the next milestone automatically transitions to `IN_PROGRESS`
- The `INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS` milestone supports a percentage progress (0–100) and a `currentActivity` string
- Completion timestamps are recorded in `dd MMM yyyy, hh:mm a` format

## 8. Application Architecture

### Architectural Pattern: MVVM + Clean Architecture

SolarEase follows a layered architecture combining MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) at the presentation layer with Clean Architecture principles for separation of concerns.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  UI Layer (Compose)                  │

```

### Layer Responsibilities

#### UI Layer (Jetpack Compose)

- All screens are Composable functions
- Each feature has a `Route` composable that wires the ViewModel to the screen
- Navigation is handled by `NavHostController` via type-safe `Screen` sealed class routes
- No business logic in Composables — only UI rendering and user event forwarding

#### ViewModel Layer

- `ViewModel` or `AndroidViewModel` (when `Application` context is needed, e.g., `AuthViewModel` for SharedPreferences)
- State is exposed as `StateFlow<UiState>` or `StateFlow<List<Model>>`
- All async operations use `viewModelScope.launch` with Kotlin Coroutines
- ViewModels do not hold references to Composables or Android Views

#### Domain Layer

- Pure Kotlin interfaces (`DashboardRepository`, `FinancialRepository`, etc.)
- Domain model data classes with no Android imports
- Calculation utilities (`EstimateCalculator`, `SubsidyCalculator`) are pure Kotlin objects

#### Data Layer

- Repository implementations (`DashboardRepositoryImpl`, `InstallationRepositoryImpl`, etc.)
- Currently uses mock data with simulated network delays (`delay()`)
- Designed for straightforward replacement with Retrofit API calls

### State Management

All UI state follows the sealed class pattern:

```kotlin
sealed class SomeUiState {
    data object Idle : SomeUiState()
    data object Loading : SomeUiState()
    data class Success(val data: SomeModel) : SomeUiState()
    data class Error(val message: String) : SomeUiState()
}
```

State is collected in the Composable using `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.

### Navigation

Navigation uses Jetpack Navigation Compose with **type-safe routes** via `@Serializable` data objects and data classes:

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class CostEstimation(
    val monthlyConsumption: Double,
    val availableArea: Double,
    val mountType: String,
    val systemType: String,
    val panelType: String,
    val customerType: String
) : Screen()
```

Route arguments are passed as typed navigation parameters (not string-encoded bundles), providing compile-time safety.

### Session Persistence

`UserSession` (singleton object) manages the authenticated user state:
- Loaded from `SharedPreferences` on app start
- Updated on login and profile completion
- Cleared on logout or DEBUG build launch
- Serialized/deserialized using `kotlinx.serialization`

```kotlin
data class User(
    val customerName: String,
    val mobileNumber: String,
    val ebServiceNumber: String? = null,
    val registrationCompleted: Boolean = false,
    val onboardingCompleted: Boolean = false,
    val installationCompleted: Boolean = false
)
```

## 9. Operations Platform Integration Plan

### Overview

All current mock data implementations must be replaced with real API calls to the SolarEase Platform backend. The integration follows a standard REST architecture with JWT authentication.

### Integration Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as SolarEase App
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant BE as SolarEase Platform Backend
    participant DB as Database
    participant FCM as FCM (Push)

    App->>GW: POST /auth/send-otp
    GW->>BE: Forward request
    BE-->>App: OTP sent via SMS

    App->>GW: POST /auth/verify-otp
    GW->>Auth: Validate OTP
    Auth-->>App: JWT Access Token + Refresh Token

    App->>GW: GET /customers/dashboard (JWT)
    GW->>Auth: Validate JWT
    Auth->>BE: Forward with customer context
    BE->>DB: Fetch dashboard data
    DB-->>BE: Customer + system data
    BE-->>App: Dashboard JSON

    BE->>FCM: Send push notification
    FCM-->>App: Notification delivered
```

---

## 14. Security

### 14.1 Authentication

- Mobile number + OTP two-factor authentication
- OTP is time-limited (expiry managed server-side)
- Maximum 3 OTP attempts before a 15-minute account lockout
- JWT access tokens with short expiry (recommended: 1 hour)
- Refresh token rotation on every access token refresh
- Refresh tokens are revocable server-side (stored in Redis or DB)

### 14.2 Session Storage

- Current implementation: `SharedPreferences` (plain)
- Production target: **EncryptedSharedPreferences** (`androidx.security.crypto`) for sensitive user data
- Session token (JWT) must be stored in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, never in plain `SharedPreferences` or hardcoded

### 14.3 API Security

- All API calls must include `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header via `AuthInterceptor`
- HTTPS enforced for all production API endpoints (TLS 1.2+)
- Firebase App Check (reCAPTCHA) is already configured in the app to protect API endpoints from abuse
- API Gateway must validate App Check token before processing requests

### 14.4 Payment Security

- No raw card or banking data stored in the app or backend
- Payment gateway (Razorpay/PayU) handles PCI-DSS compliance
- App only stores payment method type and gateway transaction reference
- All payment confirmation must be validated server-side via payment gateway webhook — never trust client-reported payment status

### 14.5 Data Protection

- Customer PII (name, phone, EB number) must be encrypted at rest in the database
- Profile photos and documents stored in access-controlled cloud storage (signed URLs with expiry)
- No logging of sensitive fields (OTP values, JWT tokens, payment details)

### 14.6 Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC) on the backend:

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| `CUSTOMER` | Access own data only |
| `SUPPORT` | View customer data, manage tickets |
| `SURVEYOR` | View assigned surveys, update survey status |
| `INSTALLER` | View assigned installations, update milestone progress |
| `ADMIN` | Full access to all data and admin operations |

- Customers must never be able to access other customers' data — all queries must be scoped by `customerId` from the JWT claims
- Milestone update APIs must require `INSTALLER` or `ADMIN` role — customers cannot self-update installation milestones

### 14.7 Input Validation

All inputs are validated both client-side and server-side:
- EB consumer number: exactly 12 numeric digits, valid region code
- Monthly consumption: positive number, max 5 digits
- Available area: positive, max 100,000 sqm
- Phone number: 10-digit Indian mobile number
- OTP: exactly 6 digits

## 16. Developer Notes

### 16.1 Coding Standards

- **Language:** Kotlin only. No Java files in the main source set.
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose only. No XML layouts.
- **Formatting:** Follow Kotlin official style guide. Use `ktlint` for enforcement.
- **Function length:** Functions should do one thing. Break down logic into small, named functions.
- **No magic numbers:** All constants belong in the relevant `Constants` object (e.g., `EstimateConstants`).
- **No business logic in Composables:** All logic belongs in ViewModels or domain utilities.

### 16.2 Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Screen Composables | `PascalCase + Screen` | `CostEstimationScreen` |
| Route Composables | `PascalCase + Route` | `CostEstimationRoute` |
| ViewModels | `PascalCase + ViewModel` | `EstimateViewModel` |
| Repository interfaces | `PascalCase + Repository` | `DashboardRepository` |
| Repository implementations | `PascalCase + RepositoryImpl` | `DashboardRepositoryImpl` |
| Domain models | `PascalCase` data class | `CustomerDashboard` |
| Result/state models | `PascalCase + Result/State` | `SolarEstimateResult`, `AuthUiState` |
| Constants objects | `PascalCase + Constants` | `EstimateConstants` |
| Utility objects | `PascalCase` | `EstimateCalculator`, `SubsidyCalculator` |
| Screen route keys | Matching sealed class names | `Screen.CostEstimation` |

### 16.3 Navigation Rules

- All routes are defined in `Screen.kt` as `@Serializable` data objects or data classes
- Route arguments must be passed as typed navigation parameters — never as strings in a bundle
- Never navigate directly to a Screen sealed class from a screen Composable — always pass navigation lambdas from the NavGraph
- Back navigation always uses `navController.popBackStack()` — never manual `navigate()` for going back
- After installation completes, the back stack is cleared to `Screen.AuthPhone` before navigating to `CustomerDashboard`

### 16.4 Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| MVVM + Clean Architecture | Separation of concerns; repository layer makes mock-to-real replacement trivial |
| Pure Kotlin calculation engine | No Android dependencies = fully unit-testable without emulator |
| Sealed class for UiState | Exhaustive state handling; prevents UI from being in an undefined state |
| SharedPreferences for session | Simple, fast, sufficient for auth state; upgrade to EncryptedSharedPreferences before production |
| Data class navigation args | Type-safe; eliminates string parsing bugs in navigation |
| Three separate milestone flows | Each workflow has genuinely different regulatory requirements — merging would create complex conditional logic |
| `DIVISOR = 120` for capacity calc | 4 peak sun hours/day × 30 days = 120; standard Indian residential solar sizing basis |
| Subsidy capped at ₹78,000 | PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana policy as of implementation date |

### 16.5 Important Business Rules

1. **Subsidy is only for On-Grid + DCR.** Any other combination returns zero subsidy. Do not change this without verifying current government policy.

2. **Net payable cannot be negative.** If subsidy exceeds gross cost (edge case for small systems), net payable is floored at 0.

3. **OTP lockout is 3 attempts.** Do not increase this for security reasons. Backend must also enforce this.

4. **Consumer number is exactly 12 digits.** TANGEDCO format only. Future versions may need to support other state DISCOM formats.

5. **Milestone auto-progression.** When a milestone is completed, the next one automatically becomes IN_PROGRESS. Do not allow manual out-of-order milestone completion from the admin panel.

6. **Back stack is cleared on installation completion.** After the customer reaches the dashboard post-installation, the entire onboarding back stack is removed. This prevents navigating back to the assessment flow after an order is placed.

7. **Three workflow templates.** On-Grid, Off-Grid, and Hybrid have different milestone sets. Adding a new system type requires adding a new milestone set in `InstallationRepositoryImpl` and a new branch in `InstallationTrackingViewModel`.

8. **DCR vs. Non-DCR pricing difference.** DCR panels command a premium (₹55,000 vs. ₹48,000/kW for rooftop) but unlock the subsidy, making them financially beneficial for eligible customers.

### 16.6 Environment Configuration

The project uses the Secrets Gradle Plugin to load environment variables from `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with actual API keys
```

Environment variables are exposed as `BuildConfig` fields in the app.

### 16.7 Debug vs. Production Behavior

| Behavior | Debug | Production |
